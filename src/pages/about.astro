          Hi, I'm {SITE.title}, a Senior Software Engineer and Full-Stack Developer.
        </p>
        <p>
         I work primarily with .NET on the backend and Angular and React on the frontend, building systems that are practical, scalable, and thoughtfully designed.
         Over the years, I've learned that good software isn't just about writing code—it's about understanding problems, making trade-offs, and continuously improving how things are built.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm naturally curious and enjoy exploring new technologies, tools, and ideas beyond my day-to-day work.
          A lot of that exploration happens in my home lab, where I experiment, break things, rebuild them, and learn by doing.
          It's where theory meets practice—and where I have the most fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          This blog is a place for me to share what I'm learning along the way: technical insights, experiments, and lessons from real-world development.
          If you're someone who enjoys understanding how things work under the hood, I hope you'll find something here that's useful or inspiring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks for stopping by.
